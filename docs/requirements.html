		<p>The game is a science fiction game in which the player explores the galaxy and trades commodities between the various ports in the galaxy.
		The user can visit orbitals, star systems, sectors, clusters, and galaxies.
		At its core, this game is a simple exercise in economics: buy low, sell high. This means that
		any particular location will likely sell any given commodity at different prices. The player
		will use the in-game currency to execute these transactions. Commodities purchased will
		be placed in the cargo hold of the player’s ship, while those sold will be removed.</p>
		
		<p>The galaxy itself is procedurally generated at the user’s request. It is a reasonable
		approximation of a real galaxy (albeit with significantly fewer star systems) and should
		provide the player with plenty of space to explore.</p>
		
		<p>After the core game elements are implemented (and if we have time), we intend to continue
		adding more functionality to the game to make it more entertaining (for example, ability to negotiate with merchants). The ultimate goal is to
		create a finished product that not only meets the requirements of this project, but also is
		actually fun to use.</p>

		<p>Start the game by clicking on the <em>Start</em> button.</p>
		<p>Procedurally generate galaxy objects:</p>

			<li> Sectors </li>
			<li> Orbitals </li>
			<ul>        
				<li> Planets</li>
				<li> Rings</li>
				<li> Moons</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>The user can travel between orbitals, star systems, sectors, clusters, and galaxies.</p>
		<p>When on the orbital, the user can trade with merchants or go to the star system by zooming out.</p>
		<p>When on the star system, the user can go the sector by zooming out or the orbital by zooming in.</p>
		<p>When on the sector, the user can go to the cluster by zooming out or to the star system by zooming in.</p>
		<p>When on the cluster, the user can go the galaxy by zooming out or to the sector by zooming in.</p>
		<p>When on the galaxy, the user can go back to the cluster.</p>
		<p>The user dies when he/she runs out of money.</p>
		<p>The user can save the state of the game. </p>
		<p>The user can reload the saved state of the game and keep on playing.</p>
