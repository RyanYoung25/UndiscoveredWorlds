The year is 2132. You are the commander of GSC-235. General Systems Cruisers are notorious for faulty warp drive and your ship was no exception. While on your mission of galactic mapping, your cruiser fell victim to the fault while touring a star system. It is now your duty as commander to navigate though the galaxy and acquire materials by trading to rebuild your warp drive. You begin the game with what Central Command left you. You have $500 and whatever supplies you have on board. You will need to analyze the local economies and determine where to buy and where to sell your goods.
